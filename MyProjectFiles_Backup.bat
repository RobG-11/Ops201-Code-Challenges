:: Purpose:
    :: Create a batch file that recursively copies Jorgeâ€™s work files on his desktop (recursively meaning to include folder contents).
    :: Your script should use ROBOCOPY as the primary means of copying the data.
    :: Schedule a Windows task to execute this batch file every night at midnight.
    :: Have your batch file generate a log file of what took place.
