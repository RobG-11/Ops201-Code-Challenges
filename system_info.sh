# Script: 07 - System Information
# Author: Robert Gregor
# Date of latest revision: 141422FFEB23
# Purpose:
    # Create script that uses lshw to display system info to screen about following components:
        # Name of the computer
        # CPU (Product, Vendor, Physical ID, Bus Info, Width)
        # RAM (Description, Physical ID, Size)
        # Display Adapter (Description, Product, Vendor, Physical ID, Bus Info, Width, Clock, Capabilities, Configuration, Resources)
        # Network Adapter (Description, Product, Vendor, Physical ID, Bus Info, Logical Name, Version, Serial, Size, Capacity, Width, Clock, Capabilities, Configuration, Resources)
    # Uses grep to remove irrelevant information from lshw output
    # Add text to output clearly indicating which component (such as CPU, RAM, etc.) script is returning info about
    # Runs as Root; may execute shell script with sudo or as Root
