### **Welcome to my Ops-201-Code-Challenges wiki!**
---------------------------------------------------

This repo is a compilation of the code I created throughout the 201 course. It is my hope it will serve as a valuable resource in my future studies & employment. These coding challenges have solidified my strong belief that the ability to automate IT & cybersecurity tasks is well within my grasp, and will be an integral part of my studies moving forward. I embrace the expectation that I will be capable of automating these actions in the workplace, and can think of numerous ways to implement what I've learned.

I truly enjoyed working with PowerShell. It felt easier to pick up for me than Python & Bash, but I have signiificant interest in mastering those languages as well. I found the PowerShell Automated Endpoint Configuration assignment to be the most interesting & useful. In the near future I intend to create another far more detailed script that includes all of the Windows security settings I typically configure on my home systems.

While I feel I have a good understanding of variables, conditionals, and loops, I feel like I still haven't truly grasped the full potential of functions. I'm looking forward to diving into the use of parameters with functions next to expand my capabilities.
